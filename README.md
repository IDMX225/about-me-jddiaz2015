# About Me ‚Äì Final Project

![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/YOUR-NETLIFY-BADGE-HERE/deploy-status)

## üë§ Author
My name is Juan Diaz, and this is my final project for the Web Development course. This "About Me" site reflects the skills I've learned throughout the semester and demonstrates my progress with HTML, CSS, GitHub, responsive design, and web publishing.

## üìå Description & Purpose
This project started with simple HTML and CSS structure, but evolved through each weekly lesson. I‚Äôve learned how to:
- Create structured HTML pages using semantic tags.
- Style pages with CSS, including box models, flexbox, and hover effects.
- Build responsive layouts using media queries.
- Use GitHub and Git branching for version control.
- Publish projects using Netlify.
- Add interactivity like a hamburger menu for mobile navigation.
- Create and embed a favicon and custom logo.
- Write a blog article and style it with CSS.

## üé® Color Scheme

Below is the color palette used for this site, with examples and codes for each major color:

|Color Example	Hex Code	RGB Code
#9cc1d3	  rgb(156, 193, 211)
#000000	  rgb(0, 0, 0)
#afd4e6	  rgb(175, 212, 230)
#fffeff	  rgb(255, 254, 255)
#ffffbf	  rgb(255, 255, 191)
#ede7ae	  rgb(237, 231, 174)

Color contrast was tested with the [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure accessibility compliance.

## üì∏ Logo and Favicon
I created a custom monogram logo that incorporates my initials using [LOGO](https://logo.com/) and exported it as an SVG. I also added it as a favicon in PNG format, replacing the original BOB icon. The logo and favicon match my site‚Äôs color scheme.

### **Image Hover Effects with HTML & CSS**

Hover effects enhance user interaction on a website by adding dynamic visual changes when a user hovers over an image. In this section, we demonstrate how to create a hover effect on an image where a caption fades in over the image when hovered.

#### How does it work?
- The **`<figure>`** element wraps the image and caption.
- CSS properties like **`transition`** and **`opacity`** are used to animate the caption's appearance.
- The image scales slightly on hover, and the caption smoothly fades in with a background overlay.

### **Animated Moving Dot**

In this section, we create an animated dot that moves smoothly across the screen. The dot is animated using CSS keyframes, where it moves back and forth horizontally, creating a dynamic effect.

#### How does it work?
- The **`<div class="moving-dot">`** creates the animated dot.
- The animation uses **CSS keyframes** to move the dot from left to right in an infinite loop.
- CSS properties like **`border-radius`**, **`position`**, and **`animation`** are used to style the dot and control its movement.

### **Citations**

- The hover effect tutorial and moving dot animation are inspired by various CSS resources and my own experimentation. No external content was directly copied from other sources.

## üîó Navigation Bar
My navbar includes links to all sections of the site and is fully responsive. For mobile, I implemented a hamburger menu using HTML and CSS that toggles the menu visibility.

## üñº Media States
I tested and adjusted the layout to look good on the following screen sizes:
- iPhone 6 (375px)
- iPad (768px)
- Desktop (1024px and up)

All elements resize cleanly and maintain readability.
