                    I'm still not very sure in what field of the IT industry i want to work,
                    but im ealready doing my research about the different career options out there.
                    </p>
                    I try to do my assigments at college, I feel that when I am home I tend
                    to work on my personal projects, so I don't put the effort that I would like to my assigments.
                    <p>
                    In my free time I like to read; I like short stories and novels, I watch some movies,
                    I spend time with my family. I like the outdoors, but during the winter I barely go outside
                    even if the weather is not that bad.

                <h2>Pride and Prejudice from Jane Austen</h2>
                <div>
                
                        <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” Mr. Bennet made no answer. “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently. “You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”</p>
    
                        <p>This was invitation enough. “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.” “What is his name?” “Bingley.” “Is he married or single?” “Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!” “How so? how can it affect them?” “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</p>
                
                        <p>“Is that his design in settling here?” “Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.” “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party.” “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”</p>
                
                        <p>“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.” “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.” “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for all of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.”</p>
                
                        <p>You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”</p>
                
                        <p>“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.” They have now gone so far as to arrange a meeting for Mr. Bingley’s coming to the ball at the Meryton assembly, where the Bennet family will present themselves to him. The invitation made by Mrs. Bennet is extended in the hope of drawing a positive response, albeit the family has their own reasons for hoping things will progress in an ideal direction.</p>
                
                        <p>As soon as the ball began, Mrs. Bennet was eager to introduce her daughters to Mr. Bingley, so that her plan could unfold without delay. Each of the girls, in turn, presented themselves with their charm, hoping to make the best impression. It was to no surprise that Mrs. Bennet showed great enthusiasm, as she believed her daughters to be in competition with others. Yet she remained determined to secure the best possible match for them, with Mr. Bingley as the perfect prospect.</p>
                
                        <p>Meanwhile, as Mr. Bingley observed the situation unfold, he took a particular liking to the eldest daughter, Jane Bennet. Mrs. Bennet, sensing an opportunity, took it upon herself to foster the budding connection. She was both eager and anxious for the future, knowing full well that the arrangement would greatly improve the family’s situation. Unbeknownst to her, Mr. Bingley’s intentions were yet unclear, but the groundwork for the romantic entanglements had been set in motion, and the hopes of the Bennet family were in full bloom.</p>
